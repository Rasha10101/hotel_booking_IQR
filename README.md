# Hotel Booking Analysis using Interquartile Range (IQR)

This Jupyter Notebook conducts an analysis of hotel booking data with a focus on identifying and handling outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. The objective is to explore key insights regarding hotel booking patterns, cancellations, and customer behavior, and to apply statistical techniques to improve data quality and analysis reliability.

## Project Overview

The notebook includes the following sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load and clean the dataset, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis.
2. **Outlier Detection with IQR**: Identify outliers in the booking data based on IQR for key features, and decide on handling methods such as removal or transformation.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends and distributions of booking behaviors, customer demographics, lead times, and cancellation rates.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Modify or create features that may provide additional insights or improve modeling.
5. **Insights and Conclusions**: Summarize findings from the analysis, highlighting the impact of outliers and customer booking behaviors.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, install the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For visualizing data patterns
- `scipy`: For advanced statistical functions

You can install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Dataset**: Ensure that the hotel booking dataset is available in the notebookâ€™s directory.
2. **Run the Notebook**: Execute each cell sequentially to reproduce the data analysis and results.
3. **Interpret the Visualizations**: Use the charts and insights provided to understand how outliers and specific booking behaviors affect the data analysis.

## Example Outputs

Key outputs include:

- **Box Plots and Distribution Charts**: Visual representations for detecting outliers and analyzing the spread of key features.
- **IQR-based Outlier Handling**: Steps for identifying and optionally treating outliers within the booking data.
- **Summary Insights**: Conclusions drawn from data analysis to support decision-making for booking management.
